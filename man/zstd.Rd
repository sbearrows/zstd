\usage{
compress_raw(src, level)

decompress_raw(src)

compress_file(s_file, d_file, level, cores = parallel::detectCores())

decompress_file(s_file, d_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{src}{Raw source vector to be compressed or decompressed.}

\item{level}{Compression levels ranging from negative 5 to 22}

\item{s_file}{Source file path of compression or decompression. Standard
file extension for compressed file is '.zst'}

\item{d_file}{Destination file path of compression or decompression. Standard
file extension for compressed file is '.zst'}

\item{cores}{For multithreading how many cores should be used. By default
this is set using parallel::detectCores()}
}
\value{
If compressing or decompressing from a raw vector the output will also
be a raw vector. If compressing or decompressing from a file path or file
connection, the output will be placed in the file pointed to by d_file.
